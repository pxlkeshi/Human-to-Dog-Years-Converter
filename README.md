# Human to Dog Years Converter 🐶

This is a beginner-friendly JavaScript program that converts your age from human years to dog years.

## How It Works
- Takes your current age and stores it in a variable
- The first 2 human years count as 10.5 dog years each
- Every year after that counts as 4 dog years
- Adds both to calculate your total age in dog years
- Also converts your name to lowercase and prints a fun message using template literals

## Example Output
My name is alex. I am 19 years old in human years which is 97.0 old in dog years
